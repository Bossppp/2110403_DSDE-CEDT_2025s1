        "FICO scores are a credit score, or a number used by banks and credit cards to represent how credit-worthy a person is. While there are a few types of credit scores used in the United States, the FICO score is the best known and most widely used.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a borrower applies for a loan, Lending Club gets the borrowers credit score from FICO - they are given a lower and upper limit of the range that the borrowers score belongs to, and they store those values as fico_range_low, fico_range_high. After that, any updates to the borrowers score are recorded as last_fico_range_low, and last_fico_range_high.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key part of any data science project is to do everything you can to understand the data. While researching this data set, I found a project done in 2014 by a group of students from Stanford University on this same dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the report for the project, the group listed the current credit score (last_fico_range) among late fees and recovery fees as fields they mistakenly added to the features but state that they later learned these columns all leak information into the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, following this group's project, another group from Stanford worked on this same Lending Club dataset. They used the FICO score columns, dropping only last_fico_range_low, in their modeling. This second group's report described last_fico_range_high as the one of the more important features in predicting accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "The question we must answer is, do the FICO credit scores information into the future? Recall a column is considered leaking information when especially it won't be available at the time we use our model - in this case when we use our model on future loans.\n",
        "\n",
        "This blog examines in-depth the FICO scores for lending club loans, and notes that while looking at the trend of the FICO scores is a great predictor of whether a loan will default, that because FICO scores continue to be updated by the Lending Club after a loan is funded, a defaulting loan can lower the borrowers score, or in other words, will leak data.\n",
        "\n",
